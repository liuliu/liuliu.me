Everyone knows that the God acts upon the world through his mysterious power called the statistical probability. Since I am an outlier from the beginning, the God acts against me from time to time. Every time, when I was happy and had fun, the God pulled me back into my little cold nutshell, and I could still count myself a king of infinite space. The God is unhappy, and I should be more careful. The God, I will not pursuit the happiness, you have my word, but I will do my best I can to avoid the pain.

And I will win, in a long term unless I am short-lived.
