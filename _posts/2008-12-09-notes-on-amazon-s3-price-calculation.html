1. A 10Mbps hosting service in China costs 50,000 RMB per year, thus, 7246 USD;

2. $7246/(10*60*60*24*365/8) = $0.0001838 USD/MiB = $0.188 USD/GiB;

3. Amazon S3 service charge $0.170 USD/GiB.

Note: it is much easier to do financial estimation based on bandwidth capacity. The calculation is rough, but amazingly corresponding.
