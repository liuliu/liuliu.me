<p>Chaotic, fantastic and dramatic.
</p><p>I don't care who I will be, somebody or nobody. My drama will show up soon. It is a comedy about my whole life. Comedic life isn't equal to happy life. One's tragedy can be others' comedy. Humanity isn't all about love, giving and forgive. There is an evil in everyone's deep mind.
</p><p>When we talk about evil, more attention should be paid to avoid the exploding of evil. So, my child, help others find their true and enjoy the happiness of giving.</p>
