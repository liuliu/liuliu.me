Introduction

When Timmy Payungka Tjapangati (ca.1940 - 2000) was a child, there was a severe drought in western Australia. His family traveled long distance from his birth place, west of lake Mackay. At South of Warburton, he met his further wife and father-in-law. In 1958, he and his extended family including his father-in-law Uta Uta Tjangala moved to Hasst Bluff, and later moved to Papunya settlement. Uta Uta Tjangala is a very knowledgeable man in rituals and stories. As a expressive dancer as he is, of many things, he is the foremost ritual authority.

Timmy Payungka Tjapangati inherited much of his knowledge of lands and rituals from his early traveling experience and his father-in-law. Geoff Bardon have suspected that Timmy was in fact a Kadaitcha man in his group. In indigenous group, Kadaitcha man was a secret position who would conduct persecution or curse. They are guardians of traditions and rituals. Therefore, a Kadaitcha man is always knowledgeable with their rituals and land stories. In 1970, school teacher Geoff Bardon had the idea to let indigenous people to decorate school doors with their original artistic style. Among the first participants, Payungka started his painting career from then.

Early Paintings

The early paintings of Payungka contained much of ritual practices and sacred symbols. At that time, western desert art haven't started its departure from its origin as ritual performing elements into contemporary art. The art is a way for him to express his root culture as well as carry practical meaning. The Sandhill country west of Wilkinkarra, Lake Mackay (1972) by all means, is a painting of landscape. It shows the geography of a sacred site near Lake Mackay. The light color represents spinifex while the dark colored areas depict the sandhill. The arrangement of dots that overlay the painting is not arbitrary. Man as knowledgeable as Payungka knew how to vividly reproduce the effect of ancestral force on paper. The semi-invisible horizontal lines that all over the dot fields shows the vibration of the ancestral power in that site. The Tingarri Story is different. If Sandhill represents a departure from the traditional west desert painting, The Tingarri Story is a faithful replication. It is a well-known dreaming story among west desert aboriginal group.

Later Paintings

During 1970s and 1980s, Payungka produced large number of paintings that revolve around rituals, dreaming stories and lands. As he produced more paintings, the techniques get improved. Kangaroo and Shield is a much larger painting. The story is convoluted too. As much as we know, it is a sacred story about Kangaroo (in the top of the painting) and the shield man (on the tracking path). It also depicts several sacred sites around lake Mackay. However, there is a turning point in 1990s that Payungka dispensed all the sacred meanings in his paintings. Rather, his later paintings are more artistically plausible. In Untitled, it is very clear that all these symbols though seems traditional, but won't have a one-to-one mapping to any sacred sites.

In the middle 1990s, some of his sacred designs were used without permission in a commercial carpet manufacture, which promoted him to paint without sacred designs but still have the same artistic themes.

Go Back to the Root

The parallel similarities can be found between Payungka's painting and Uta Uta Tjangala's are striking. However, it won't surprise us once we learned that Uta Uta is the father-in-law of Payungka. In The Old Man's Drawing, Uta Uta told a story of ancestral being referred as the Old Man.

Storytelling of a Kadaitcha Man

One should look no further than The Old Man's Drawing to find the storytellings from a Kadaitcha man. The essential part of a story that Kadaitcha man interested in is the punishment. which is exactly what made the story of the Old Man's Drawing interesting. [insert the story].

Timmy Payungka Tjapangati's dreaming stories is not all about punishment if any of them is.
