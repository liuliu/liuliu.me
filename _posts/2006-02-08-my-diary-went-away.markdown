I burnt my diary, which covers my 3-year secondary school life. All good things and bad things have gone away with it.


This occurred by an unaware mistake. I put my diary in a very public place so that mum could reach it. She read some lines that did not belong to her. I cannot put a filter in my paper diary you know. The only thing I could do is to detroy the diary immediately.


sigh...I cannot face my parents after this "incident". I cannot imagine who I could be after mum read this, and my perfect figure was pulled down.


I will not write diaries any longer. I just cannot bear to put my real face to others.
