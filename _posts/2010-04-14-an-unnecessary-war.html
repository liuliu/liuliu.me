In 1991, after the liberation of Kuwait, the U.N. army chose not to invade Iraq and left Saddam's regime untouched. 12 years later, when it was crystal clear that the International sanction would not swing Saddam's regime, police makers in Washington started to worry what would happen if the deterring measure fails. The consequent threat of WMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) as a failure of deterrence urgent the United States to take action. However, the answer from President Bush's administration is a war on flimsy foundation [1]. Instead of a full military invasion, the United States could overthrow Saddam's regime by leveraging International politic &amp; military pressure and providing actual military support to revolutionists within Iraq.

To overthrow Saddam's regime, the U.S. could have played more active role in Iraq by enforcing democracy reform. After the Persian Gulf War, Saddam would do anything to avoid a direct military confrontation with the U.S. forces. During the Persian Gulf War, Saddam didn't launch biomedical /chemical weapons against coalition forces; instead, he moved his military forces from Kuwait rather quickly. In 1991, Saddam already realized that there is no point to confront with the only superpower in the world. Just before the Ultimatum, Saddam Hussein permitted the nuclear weapon inspector's work in Iraq and reached a "limited" agreement [2]. It was a positive signal that Saddam Hussein would obey the U.S. request if it came with a face-saving way. However, the quest in the Ultimatum [3] which urgent Saddam and his family to leave Iraq within 48 hours was a too aggressive move. There is no way that Saddam would be willing to give up all his power and embarrass himself by leaving Iraq. If only the U.S. could have put effort on a more strategic way to weaken the current regime first by wisely using the politic and military pressure in polite way, it would be much easier to remove Saddam's regime from inside.

To overthrow Saddam's regime, the U.S. should have supported local revolutionists instead of dispatching our own troops. Though the U.N. forces didn't support the uprising of Shi'a and Kurd in 1991, the two groups were still against Saddam and his regime. However, because of the short supply of food, water and medicine, they were unlikely to organize an effective revolution. With the U.S. support and continuous weakening of the current regime, a bottom-up revolution would likely have happened and a new leader would have emerged from the revolution. Actually, immediately after the military invasion, a Shi'a group of rebellions were quickly organized under the al-Sadr ("The Mahdi Army") [4]. It reveals that once Saddam's regime weakened, a grass-root revolution would have happened. A revolution within Iraq would have saved the U.S. from a lot of troubles for the reconstruction of Iraq.

The full military invasion to Iraq would terrify neighbor nations in the Middle East and the exercise of preventative war made a bad example for the rest of the world. The action showed that the U.S. as the only superpower can use military means to remove any disliked regimes in the world. Iran, which was also part of the "axis of evil" [5], would like to be prepared for the potential U.S. invasion. North Korea would act more insanely in term of military and more actively seek nuclear weapons. A major International military confrontation without prove of the U.N. Security Council will further weaken the role of the U.N.S.C. in important International issues. By bypassing the U.N.S.C., it may be quicker for the U.S. to make decisions in a unipolar world, but it is not a wise move towards a multi-polar world in the new century. It would be very difficult to debate in the future if a powerful dictator cites the U.S. action (pro-act self-defense) in 2003 as a justification for his own invasion.

The popular perspective to the Iraq problem would argue that the military invasion was our last attempt to solve the Iraq problem since all non-military attempts to disarm Iraq have failed. However, it is not true. The Iraq problem caught major attention in 2002 was largely contributed by the "axis of evil" speech. Except Iraq problem specialists and long-term advocates, few people in the U.S. paid attention to the poor Middle East country before that. If we could put more resources in strategic way, we would realize that there are more than one solution to the Iraq problem. Military intervention is the hard way with casualties of U.S. solders' lives. A soft way, which weaken and overthrow the current regime, would be less expensive in terms of human lives.
