I've tested OnLive just now. Overall, it is very impressive. The resolution is high, the picture is awesome. These guys put much effort to finally pull it off. However, the latency is a huge problem. I can fell it clearly in the GRID racing game. It is a typical case that one put money and effort to but the technology is not mature enough for their fate. Good luck to them.
