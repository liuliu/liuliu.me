<p>I burnt my diary, which covers my 3-year secondary school life. All good things and bad things have gone away with it.
</p><p>This occurred by an unaware mistake. I put my diary in a very public place so that mum could reach it. She read some lines that did not belong to her. I cannot put a filter in my paper diary you know. The only thing I could do is to detroy the diary immediately.
</p><p>sigh...I cannot face my parents after this &quot;incident&quot;. I cannot imagine who I could be after mum read this, and my perfect figure was pulled down.
</p><p>I will not write diaries any longer. I just cannot bear to put my real face to others.</p>
