One thing that bothers me when reading <a title=" As a VC, how is a $41 million investment in an unproven social media application like Color justified?" href="http://www.quora.com/Color-Labs-startup/As-a-VC-how-is-a-41-million-investment-in-an-unproven-social-media-application-like-Color-justified/answer/Robert-Scoble-1" target="_blank">Robert Scoble</a>'s assertion on "the Next Facebook" is: no big companies in his list are founded by a "serial entrepreneur". No, I am not saying Bill Gates, Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg are not entrepreneurs. They are true entrepreneurs who can found a company, grow it and pilot it for a very long time. Nor am I dismissing the fact that them may have some small successes in the past.

I want to know that if they are entrepreneurs in heart, why they don't have an amazing tracking record before big ones? Here is my educated guess: the chance of hitting big is so small that the sheer number of inexperienced entrepreneurs outnumbered the serial ones.

Or there is a gene that prohibits a serial entrepreneur to hit something big.
