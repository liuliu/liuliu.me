Starting from my middle school, I was facinated by the puzzle of business success: people from all walks of life can be huge success in business perspective. Can I find any pattern of how these people succeed? There are books like <em>Built to Last</em> / <em>Good to Great</em> want to figure out pretty much the same thing.

From time to time, I realize that luck plays a big role in business success. However, that doesn't necessary mean there is only randomness is the pattern of business success.
