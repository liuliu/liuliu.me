I am not a big fan of Wikileaks, and I am still not sure what all these leaks meaning regarding to national security and international politics. But it reminds me that once for a while, we need something like Wikileaks to tell us what all the new-passed law is really about and what the government is really capable of doing. Now, we at least know the following: 1). any organization can be purposed as foreign terrorist organization at will; 2). Interpol can arrest any person in the world who facing minor or no charges; 3). any senator can put enough pressure on companies to do anything he/she wants.

If no one reminds people what the government can do, any country can be turned into totalitarianism state overnight. Have I said that it happened twice in the history of America?
