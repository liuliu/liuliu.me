Fotas.net is always proud of its "[dynamic folder](http://www.vimeo.com/1927194)" technology. Now, with NDQI (Non-structural Data Query Interface), the new fotas.net collection (former name "dynamic folder") will be more powerful and finally syntax-complete.

After the domain issue was solved, new fotas.net which schedule to be released in June will contain more than a dozen new concepts and innovations such as portfolio-based manage layer, new js upload API, all-ajaxed admin page etc.
