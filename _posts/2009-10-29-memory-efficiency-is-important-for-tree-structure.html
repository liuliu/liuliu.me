When implementing general tree structure, people sometimes just forgets how important the memory efficiency is. At least, I was. The first mistake that made I aware of this issue is in the implementing radix tree (prefix tries). Radix tree is a tree structure with more than 2 children (26 children / 16 children is the common pattern). That's where the common knowledge isÂ challenged. When implementing binary tree, we always allocate two pointers (left node/right node). If we follow the common knowledge and allocate 26/16 pointers, it becomes a huge waste. When a tree structure needs to hold millions of objects (which is common these days) in memory, a constant waste of 4*16 bytes is large.

Most time we think the tree structure is more memory efficient than hash table.
