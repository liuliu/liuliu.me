You must knew one or two of these people. They are childhood best friends of some well-known names. They know people in high positions. They are some kind of legendary in the early 21st century. They are networking people.

THE BROKER

Brokers, some of you may not be familiar with the name any more used to be a common scene in stock market before 1980s. Their work was to match buy price to sell price and made the deal happen. However, there came the electronic broker system, and nowadays, most transactions are made with E-broker system rather than human brokers.

THE SOCIAL NETWORK SITE

Some old-fashion people would claim that Facebook made us loners. But believe or not, it is a great tool (let's put a side the proprietary nature of it) to efficiently maintain your friendship. Virtual social networks would never fade, they will only evolve simply because they are useful.

NEW KIND OF INCUBATOR

When you consider Y-Combinator, the phenomenal startup incubator in Silicon Valley, it becomes obvious how the future is. It is a standardized procedure for application, it uses the standardized term sheet and most of all, it is scalable. Heck, it double the total number of funded startups every 6 months.

THE PUNCHLINE

Y-Combinator is many things, but for one, it is an experiment to eliminate the networking cost.
