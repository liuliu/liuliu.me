Making "the Process" Accountable

When Jocelyn said about the tool, the people and then the process in that order, it takes a while for me to adjust to that weighting. After a few months, when I think about it again, it is to me, more about accountability.

Accountability gives you a short cycle about where to improve. When a tool is at fault, you will immediately know. It is either a crash, or a excessively long building time or a duplicate work (one on computer, one on paper). If a tool doesn't work out, we know where to improve. That's evident, and this is the accountability of tools.

When it comes to people, it is far less clear who is accountable, or where to improve, but over time, we have "git blame", we have peer review, thus, who is accountable, and where to improve becomes a manageable problem.

It is even less clear about processes. Process is something one becomes custom to, institutionalized for. It is the easiest target to point finger at but hardest one to constructively improve on. Process includes the part of human, and the part of tools, and then glue them together into a giant machinery that moves forward. There are so many moving parts, and for any reasonable people, it is easier to constructively suggesting themselves (human error) as the source of trouble, and improving on that. For unreasonable people, it is easy to target at process and do nothing about it and feel great about themselves.

Erroneous tools get fixed, crappy processes last. The natural selection of processes comes from the rise and failure of companies. Only when Japanese car manufacturers are taking over the world, people give serious look at Six Sigma or Quality without Tears, and only when a company failed, people take a step back and ask, why with these brilliant people, it doesn't work out? That's when, normally, a process failed and was noticed.

Can we do better? Can we quantitatively assess a process, and more wisely experiment with it, and improve on it? Personally, I believe that we can, but it takes time, effort, and serious thinking and communicating about what we do, and how we do it.

For a process to work, there need one set-off objective about why we think that adopting this process will do, not what it will help at. For a fixed-date release process, our objective is to make sure that developers didn't push buggy features in for deadlines, as a result, having better quality software. Thus, we believe the hypothesis that less stress on developer side will result better software, we trust this hypothesis because it makes sense. Better software is what we hope this process would help about, but for the process, the solely objective is about less last-minute check-ins and crash landing diffs.

Luckily, with today's version control software, we can quantitatively measure that, by the rate of diff check-ins, the number of feature diffs and number of bugfix diffs for a given day. We've been good at fix-date release cycle on www and it is the key for the success, we have enough data on www to help us make judgment calls about if we achieved the similar thing on native software development when experimenting.

I don't believe that a process is a mysterious thing that we just get custom to and get over it. The same set of things that works for making great tools, user-facing software, namely, the data, the survey, and the well-informed judgment calls, could apply and improve process as well. Let's make it accountable, thus, better.
