It looks pretty now: a good job, fresh graduated from college, and an IPO event followed by graduation ceremony. Standing on the Rotunda, walking on the Lawn, everyone is smiling. Survived from college, toast for a day, why not having fun at this enjoyable and lovely moment?

No, it is fake. Don't get me wrong, I love my university, but I've celebrated when I learned something new. I've celebrated when Buddha was died, and after five hundreds years, he wrote the first book of Buddhism. I've celebrated when Eichmann built the gas chamber, and killed millions of Jews a.k.a. Holocaust. I've celebrated when eight thousands years ago, a homosapien child was killed as a mere opportunistic advantage. Celebrations can so inappropriate that even these above word combinations are very offensive to many people. That's when I stopped to celebrate, and started to reflect.

I've shipped zero in the past four years.

Sometimes, one needs something to wake him up everyday in the morning. A hot sweaty sex before brunch, a funny professor's class or a sense of urgency that without me, there is no tomorrow for humankind.
