It is not long ago that our phones were colorful yet with tiny screen without any fancy animations. Fast forwards now, it is not even called "phones", we call it "cells". It is what Apple envisioned 20 years ago with Newton, and what Bill Gates always in mind, he called it "tablets". But this is far from the end of the story, it is the fundamentals that  transformed the mobile phone industry and it will transform every physical devices with computing capacity that we've known of.

Mobile phone is the "niche". It is small enough, it has large user base and there is big money involved. In prior-Apple days, Nokia is a 100B company that was comfortable in its zone. If one with the determination to modernize all physical devices, it is neither MP3 player nor laptop to begin with. It is always this tiny, little mobile phone. If a rock solid Operating System can fit in the mobile phone, and runs for 24 hours with a single battery, it surely can fit into the car, the refrigerator, the TV, the vacuum, the heater, the air conditioner, almost everything.

The Failure of Outsourcing
--------------------------

A decade ago, in software development world, we became familiar with the word of outsourcing. If things as complex as car-making can be outsourced to China, why not software development? In theory, if software development can be done by more capable hands, such as IBM, wouldn't it be far superior than home-brew ones? But there are some serious mis-placed incentives when outsourcing. As a result, your 100 bucks GPS is better than the embedded GPS that raised the car price by one grands and what you left is the auto parking system in your Lexus that Jeremy Clarkson just laughed about in Top Gear. A companies with capable management wouldn't outsource their core competencies. A map company wouldn't outsource their data collection process, a bank wouldn't outsource their investment strategy making process and a car company won't outsource their car design. Things that eventually get outsourced are the add-ons, these low-priority stuffs, like ... the embedded GPS. Here is the gotcha: the car manufacturers is not the target customer of the GPS system, what they care is the price, and what kind of the profit cut they get. It is a low-priority stuff, a 1 grand embedded GPS with mediocre quality won't hurt their customer base. Thus, a embedded GPS company has no incentive to make the interface intuitive for their customers. It cuts down the price to the lowest, and deliver a mediocre embedded device and call it a success. The whole world suffers from mediocre softwares. How many man-hours has been wasted on the counter-intuitive Microwave menus, confusing government on-line forms and the automatic answering system? It can be better, but the incentives are not right, and the world-class programmers / designers won't care.

Write Once and Run it Everywhere
--------------------------------

But once, there was a promise, and that's why almost all business-class softwares are developed with either Java or .NET. A company named after the famous Stanford university has promised the world that you can write once, and run it everywhere. Only if the promise is valid. But soon, software vendor found that the different computing capacities of device is a real headache. Many embedded devices cannot even run full-stack Java Virtual Machine smoothly. A software vendor can either develop with J2EE, the stripped-down version of Java, or J2SE, the full-stack one. But neither gives you the full capacity of your computing device due to compatibility considerations. Then, the problem becomes to find the greatest common divisor among computing devices, and here it is, the mobile phone.

The mobile phone is the ideal embedded computer. It is small, lasts for a day and most importantly, is tested by hundreds of millions of people around the world. Not until the very recently (e.g. the publish of iPhone 3GS at summer 2009), the mobile phone finally got the matchable computation power as low-end portable computers (e.g. Eee PC). It seems that write once and run it everywhere finally here.

The De-facto Framework

iOS becomes the most reasonable platform to start with. The resolution is consistent, applications get sandboxed. An application that was developed with iOS platform can
