Snap for iPad

When the first time I heard that the next iPad is going to ship with an upgraded camera, there is a strange feeling. No, iPad is not a point-to-shot camera, it is a taking-note and consumption device, and what's the deal with that camera?

There are several scenarios.

1. After an intense debate in the conference room and a lot sketches on the white-board, it is just too wasteful to not record anything. So you pull out your iPhone/iPad/Galaxy Nexus, and take a photo of the white-board, send an email to everyone.

2. It is just you alone, in the cafeteria, and wondering what's your dream house would look like. The couch should not be so close to my 55-inch Samsung TV, no, no table in front of my couch, maybe a small one in the middle of two super cozy sofa, leaving enough space for my Kinect. At the same time, you sketched of all this on a A4 paper, or any drawing application on your iPad, whatever, you shared it with your other half by either taking a photo of it, or send the drawing picture to her.

3. There is an interesting singer at Red Rock cafe. Taking a video of her and let her sign it, how cool will that be. Let me brag about it on my Facebook afterwards.

4. A chit-chat, "Have you seen the interesting Google driver-less car? I just happened to take a photo of it the other day." "Can you send it to me?" "What's your email address again?"

The above is all about record something and share it. But it is not just a point-shot camera with Facebook Connect. It is much more complex than that because the editing involved. These editings can only be done on a larger screen. For example, an iPad with a powerful camera?

1. You point your iPad at the white-board, taking a picture. The application will automatically scale/crop/scan the photo, making every words on it search-able, and then, you can drag it to one of your Facebook Group, no email, done.

2. The same application, draw a picture is just as easy as taking a photo, and then, drag it to your other half's icon. Bang, she see the picture immediately on her Facebook Message.

3. It is just as simple as that, taking a video, sign it, and share.

4. Pull out that photo you saved on Snap for iPad, and he will point his iPad on yours, the system handles everything, no email, done.

Still confused by how these different functionalities can be combined into one application? See the sketch:


One thing I want to clarify is the "point-and-sharing". It strikes me as nonsense to go over email and share something with another person. AirDrop is good, but if you are a Star Trek fan as I am, they don't drag things around. It is direct, if you want to share something with someone, pointing their iPad camera to yours, and it is done. Why should you ask questions like "What's your email address?" or "What's your iPad name?" if the very device is on his hand right here right now?

Side Note:

Why is it Snap for iPad?

Yes, it is very different from Snap for iPhone, but I think the concept is valid: producing quality multi-media content and sharing.

What's the difference between this and Evernote?

Evernote is not intended to share. It is a personal note that syncs with its server. It keeps your mind clear by offloading content to Evernote. But this is about sharing and collaboration.
