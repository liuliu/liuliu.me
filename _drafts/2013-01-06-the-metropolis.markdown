"Are you from Shanghai?", she asked. I was shocked - how does she know? Am I wearing something strangely Shanghainese? Feeling the impulse to answer, I said, "you see, pretty lady, I did live in Shanghai for two years, for business purpose, and I loved that city, but in the strict sense, ...". "But you are Chinese,", she impolitely interrupted me.

"Yeah, and where are you from?", I became curious about this lady, for what she asked. "Ofakim", seeing me puzzled, she added, "Israel". "Ah! For what it is worth, I only know Jerusalem and Tel Aviv."

"I only know Shanghai and Beijing in China, and Tokyo and Seoul, these are my best guesses for Asians."

"Why Hawaii?"

"For business, and it is always warm and cozy too!"

"But nothing can beat the beach in Tel Aviv, at least that is what I heard. Or what about mainland, such as, San Diego, or Los Angles?"

"Don't ever go to San Diego! It is a lie! I've been there for the August, and the sea water is around 60F the whole time!"

"You are just being picky. 60F is perfectly fine if you wear clothes." sensed this probably was being picky too, I switched the topic, "but if given unlimited money, which city you want to live, like, spending the rest of the life with?"

"Errh, that's hard. I only have been to a handful of cities."

"Just pick one."

"New York, probably."

"It is the greatest city in the world, I'll give you that."

"Don't you like it? New York is lovely!"

"Yes, it is. The culture fusions, and the buildings, you cannot stop admiring all these concretes in 1920s. But,"

"But?"

"The weather is always misty and cloudy. You cannot beat the sunshine in California. You will miss the rainbow in Hawaii, these are such a likable touch."

"Where would you like to spend the rest of your life with?"

"You'd better ask who. But seriously, I am really in love with Penang island."

"Isn't that somewhere in southeast Asia?"

"What! You know it? Yes, it is in Malaysia. I spent the most wonderful time of my years in there."

"Did you meet the girl of your dream there?"

"No, but I regularized my life quite a bit, with tennis, badminton, jogging and tanning."

"You are not fit, at all."

"On that part, I lay my blame on the United States."
